>  Replace existing Google Chrome homepage with unlimited links to your favorite pages.

This application will provide you a homepage for quickly accessing your favorite sites. Google Chrome does provide this option but unfortunately it is limited to 10 websites only. Using **Quicklinks** you can practically store unlimited number of links for quick access.

Set the application as your homepage :)
